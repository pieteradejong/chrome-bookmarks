* Based on `Bookmarks` (``.json` format), which on Chrome for Mac should be readily accessible in a directory like `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/[your profile name]`. 
* Find your local Chrome profile directory by navigating to `chrome://version/` in Chrome, and looking for `Profile Path`.

**Background**: I wanted to detect duplicate bookmarks and broken links among my bookmarks. Chrome stores bookmarks locally, which enables local analysis.
